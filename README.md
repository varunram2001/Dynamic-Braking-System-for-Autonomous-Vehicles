# Dynamic-Braking-System-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

This project aims to create a Braking system for Autonomous Vehicles. While the Autonomous Vehicle industry is a pretty expensive affair and we don't see these vehicles very commonly in India, especially in the middle class households, this project aims to build a cheap and affordable yet a safe braking system for the autonomous vehicles in order to reduce the overall cost.
